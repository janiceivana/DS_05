1. Identify the software components or blocks. Your software will likely consist of several blocks (eg: UI, backend etc) You need to identify these. You need not go into a lot of details here. Two to three levels of decomposition are ok.

a. Identify the main user interface. Consider who will be using your software and where it might be used.

The main user interface of this project would be a website. Depends on the availability of the webpage, which depends on the client. An open source, price elasticity model would be an amazing resource to help smaller retailers in Australia. If the model is marginally better than that of current technology, bigger retailer chains like Coles and Woolworth would also be interested in this project.

Since the data is based off Walmart, a popular and successful general retail chain in America, we would have to assume that the model will work most effectively with general retail chain in Australia such as Coles or Woolworth. Since it is a webpage, there are hope that it will also work with smaller retail businesses as it is very accessible to them.
